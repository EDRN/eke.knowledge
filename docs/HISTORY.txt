Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release.

1.0.1 - Date Dumbening
----------------------

It used to be you could call an Archetypes's DateTimeField mutator method with
a string like::

    '2011-05-04T13:29:26.311Z'

However, the alleged "fix" to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10141 broke
that.  This release works around that problem by chopping off milliseconds
(and UTC "zulu" indicator) before passing the string onto the mutator.
